FOCUS:
- Box Model
- flexbox
- positioning
- alignment
- grid
- typography
- responsiveness
- spacing

  One Major Lesson Learnt here is:
  "Its best to have a vision and be able to map out that vision, so as
  to follow through with it without fail; but whats even better is to have
  a dynamic mindest, in that there is always some other type of way to
  achieve said dream"
